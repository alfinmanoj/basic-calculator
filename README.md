## 🧪 How to Use

### 👉 Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfinmanoj/basic-calculator.git



🧠 Logic Details

All buttons dynamically update the display

A custom calculate() function is used to parse and evaluate expressions

Expressions are evaluated left to right (no operator precedence)

eval() is not used — instead, secure and manual logic is implemented

📝 Future Enhancements

Add parentheses and proper operator precedence

Implement scientific functions (√, ^, log, etc.)

Add a calculation history panel

Add a light/dark theme toggle
